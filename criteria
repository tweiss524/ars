Grade: 94

## ease of accessing package, help, tests:

Fine.

## main help page:

Fine.

## quality of user interface:

Good, in particular defaults make sense.
But doesn't allow user to provide a vector of x_init values, which would be good as an option.

## performance on my tests:

Very good, though some difficulties with initialization if initial value not provided.

## t density output:

Detects non log-concavity but fails if x_init not provided.

## presence of tests:

Tests run but 1 of them fails.

── Error (test-ars.R:45): provides samples close to actual distribution ────────
Error in `ks.test.default(nor_ars, true_nor)`: not enough 'x' data

Good overall tests of main function. Extensive unit tests.

## code efficiency:

0.5 sec. for 5000 samples

## comments in code:

Good.

## code organization/clarity/elegance:

Generally easy to follow.

Optimization should be done on log scale. (see comment about initialization above)

Envelope calculation is vectorized.

You should only recalculate the probs when a point is added to abscissae.

## equality of workload:

Good.

## writeup:

Clear and detailed. Good set of examples/tests.
